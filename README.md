# Youtube Data Harvesting and Warehousing Project
Project mainly focus on extracting the data from scraping using API key, saving in MongoDB then pushing to SQL to extract datas by writing queries. The project is collaborated with Python, MongoDB and SQL.  

## Roadmap
- YOUTUBE API KEY --> MONGODB --> SQL --> DATA ANALYSIS
- STREAMLIT

## Getting started
* Fetch a youtube api key though Google Cloud platform
* Install the require packages for scraping the data using youtube api documentation
* Get Channel_id from youtube and collect the requires data (channel, videos, comments)
* The resulted data was merged and stored in a jason format
